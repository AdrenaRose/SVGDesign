# SVGDesign

This application allows a user to create a basic SVG logo from the command line. The user will type up to three characters to be displayed on one of three shape options - triangle, circle, and square. The user can input a color keyword (blue) or a hexadecimcal code to choose both the text color and background color of their logo. Once all prompts have been answered, the application will create an svg file using the user's answers.
